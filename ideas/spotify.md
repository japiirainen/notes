Recently I have been kind of wanting a command line tool to control `spotify`.
I looked online for solutions and found terminal `clients` but not really anything
like I had in my mind.

I would like to do things like:

```bash
spotify next

spotify prev

spotify gorillaz

spotify 'Face to Face'
```

It would also be quite nice to have a `neovim` plugin to make these actions.
