# One arm pull-up

## training

october 2024:

currently doing one arm negatives, one arm scapula pull-ups, and max 3x3 weighted pull-ups.
Thus far, I've been seeing clear progression with doing just these exercises each week.

## experiment ideas

- I'd like to try to swap weighted pull-ups with assisted one-arms.
